#description: Given a 3d point cloud, assign planar surfaces different colors.
#
#   We do this in the following way:
#       Classify each point by its local plane. A point is planar iff its kxk neighborhood has a good-fitting plane.
#       Two points are locally coplanar iff they have the same (or close enough) normal. Local normal is defined by the normal of the 
#       best-fitting plane in a kxk neighborhood.
#
#   (1) First, we load an image file into an Image object. This object contains a 2-d array of Point objects. Each Point object just contains the coordinates,
#   color, type (planar, nonplanar, or unknown), and equivalence class label (indicating what plane it belongs to; all points start out with an eclass of -1, which
#   means unlabeled.)
#
#   (2) Once we have the image in a data structure we call are_locally_coplanar() on every point. This function decides whether the point is fit by a kxk neighborhood
#    by the following:
#               (A) find the centroid of these kxk points
#               (B) find the difference between each point and the centroid, multiply the result with its transpose, and summing up those products to get matrix A
#               (C) find smallest eigenvalue of resulting A
#               (D) The normal is the eigenvector of A corresponding to that eigenvalue
#               (E) if eigenvalue is below a certain user-defined threshold then these points are coplanar by this measure and return True

#   (3) If are_locally_coplanar returns false, we say it's nonplanar and move on to the next point. But if it returns true, we say that the point is planar and the points 
#   are neighbors for the purposes of the sequential labeling algorithm. This algorithm then assigns the point to an equivalence class (which represents a distinct plane) 
#   in the following way:
#               (A) If its NW neighbor is labeled, give it that label.
#               (B) Else if its N and W neighbors are both labeled, give it the N's label and add both to the same equivalence class.
#               (C) Else if only one of N or W is labeled, give it that label
#               (D) Else, give the point a new label and assign it to its own equivalence class.
#
#   (4) Then we just assign each equivalence class its own random color = array([ random.randint(0,255) , random.randint(0,255) , random.randint(0,255) ]), and print them
#   to a file. I'm outputting a .pts file instead of a .ptx because my understanding is that .pts only has four elements per row, while the .pts has six, the last three being
#   the color.  I also output a boundary.pts giving the nonplanar points in red and the planar points in blue.

#
#   Comments on output:
#       If the threshold is set very low, then all points will be unlabeled, which means they'll all have the same color.
#       If the threshold is very high, then we get very few distinct planes (eg at threshold = 0.1, the small example is all the same color except for a few points).
#
#       A threshold of pthresh = 0.00001 was too small, even for the small example: every point was a 'boundary' point.  
#       Thresholds of 0.0001 and 0.001 produce same output on the small example. 0.0001 finds too many boundary points on big example,
#       but 0.001 doesn't always distinguish between two different planes, so the best threshold for the big example if it exists must be in between 
#       those two values. I used 0.0005 which seemed to give good results the large image and worked fine on the small one too.
#
#       The small example looks like only three planes, but due to the discontinuities in the larger plane, the larger plane itself is broken up into
#       smaller planes. I could not get rid of this effect using only this algorithm, since the discontinuities are 'stronger' than the border between the
#       larger plane and the adjacent, second-largest plane: at a larger threshold, that legitimate border disappears before the discontinuities on the largest plane do.
